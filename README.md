## Summary:
With global temperatures rising, Earth's two ice sheets, Greenland and Antarctica, have been melting, introducing large amounts of freshwater into the ocean. This introduction of freshwater alters ocean salinity, which may weaken ocean currents.

## Introductory Background Information:
Accelerated glacial melt has been a concern for many reasons in recent times, one of which is the potential that this melt will weaken ocean currents. An analysis done on the Atlantic ocean currents specifically predicts that the weakening of these currents will lead to a significant decrease in temperatures in North American and parts of Eurasia [1]. This is because the Gulf Stream, the major ocean current in the north Atlantic, circulates warmer waters from the equator up towards Greenland, where the water cools and sinks, traveling back down the the equator. If the Gulf Stream ceases to perform this circulation, the warm water near the equator will not travel northward [1]. Greenland is generally melting at a faster rate than Antarctica, hence the general focus on the northern oceans, but both ice sheets average out to have hundreds of billions of tons of melting each year [2]. With Greenland and Antarctica holding about 99% of the Earth's freshwater ice, this mass introduction of freshwater, which appears to increase each year, could drastically change the ocean's salinity, thus disrupting the ocean currents [1][2].

## Problem Statement, Questions and Objectives: 

**Problem Statement:** We are going to analyse how glacier melt impacts ocean salinity and see if that has an affect on deep-sea currents. 

**Questions:**  
- What are the potential effects of declining salinity on deep-sea currents?
- How has glacier mass loss from Greenland, Antarctica, and Alaska contributed to changes in ocean salinity over time?
- How do variations in ocean salinity correspond to shifts in ocean surface currents and deep-water circulation patterns?

**Objectives:**
- Analyze changes in glacier melt over time 
- Analyze changes in salinity over time
- Analyze changes in ocean current over time
- Piece together data to see if there is an association between glacier melt and changes in ocean current using change in salinity.

## Tools and Packages:

## Planned Methodology:

## Expected Outcomes:
We expect to see from our data sets that the mass lost in Greenland and Antarctica is significant and has been increasing over the years, that the overall salinity of the oceans, particularly the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, has gone down over the years, and that the ocean currents have been weakening over the years.
