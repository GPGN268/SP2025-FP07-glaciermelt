# SP2025-FP07-glaciermelt
Final project repo for the glacier melt runoff effect on ocean current 

## Group Members:
- Raquel Dickinson
- Aucklynn Sacco

## Summary:
With global temperatures rising, Earth's two ice sheets, Greenland and Antarctica, have been melting, introducing large amounts of freshwater into the ocean. This introduction of freshwater alters ocean salinity, which may weaken ocean currents.

## Introductory Background Information:

## Problem Statement, Questions and Objectives: 

**Problem Statement:** We are going to analyse how glacier melt impacts ocean salinity and see if that has an affect on deep-sea currents. 

**Questions:**  
- What are the potential effects of declining salinity on deep-sea currents?
- How has glacier mass loss from Greenland, Antarctica, and Alaska contributed to changes in ocean salinity over time?
- How do variations in ocean salinity correspond to shifts in ocean surface currents and deep-water circulation patterns?

**Objectives:**
